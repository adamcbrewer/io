Thoughts on web technologies. From null.


## The Concept

The are tonnes of blogs out there. However, there can never to many good resources and I'm hoping <a href="http://io.brewerlogic.com" target="_blank" title="io.brewerlogic.com">this blog</a> is one of them.

Responsive builds, optimised loading, file concatenation and minifying, best practices and as well as tips and tricks I find around the web. I might also write about a few thing unrelated to web development from time to time.

I'm disclosing the source for this thing, which will be updated and discussed as I go along. When functionality to the site need to be added, I'll commit the changes and post my reasoning up online. The two should git together quite well.

Enjoy!
